**Soccer Racing** combines all the fun of soccer with the thrill of a racing game.

Grab the ball, go through all the checkpoints while avoiding the opposing team, and **go for the goal!**

## Controls :
- **left/right** : turn
- **space** : tackle (without the ball) / shoot (with the ball)

Created in 47 hours for LDJAM41 using Unity, Photoshop, After Effects, Medium, Figure, Blender, Cinema4D, AssetForge, XSplit and Github. And Spotify in the background.
